This is the final project for our Principles and Technologies for Data Science course. We have chosen to work on "leave blank."

## Installation
To run this project, make sure to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy selenium selenium-wire pyobjc-framework-webkit webdriver-manager scipy scikit-learn statsmodels pmdarima
```

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each with its unique purpose:

- **Scraping**: This directory contains the core functionality of our scraper. It includes the main function for running the scraper and the Selenium commands used for scraping.

- **EDA and Data Cleaning**: This is where we perform exploratory data analysis and clean our scraped data. It houses all the scripts and notebooks used in these data preprocessing steps.

- **Clustering**: In this directory, we apply different clustering techniques to our data. Here, you'll find our implementation of various sequences and three distinct clustering methods.

- **Time Series Prediction**: Our time series prediction models are contained in this directory. We have implemented three different types of time series predictions here: ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet.

## Usage

You can clone this repository and run the main functions in each directory to see the results of our project.
